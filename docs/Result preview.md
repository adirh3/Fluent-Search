## Preview Feature in Fluent Search

Fluent Search includes a **Preview** feature that allows you to quickly preview results using various installed modules. Whether you’re looking at files, websites, images, or folders, **Preview** provides an interactive way to see content without opening external applications.

### How to Use Preview

#### Opening the Preview Panel

Preview can be toggled in two ways:

- Press **`Alt + P`** (default)
- Click the preview icon in the top-right corner of the Fluent Search window

#### Opening Preview in a Separate Window

Some results offer an **Open preview in a separate window** action. This is useful when you want to keep the preview visible while continuing to search.

#### Enabling Auto Preview for Results
You can configure **automatic preview rules** based on result types:
- Navigate to **Settings > Preview > Interactions**.
- Set rules for which results should automatically open in the preview panel.

### Available Preview Modules

Fluent Search includes several built-in **Preview Modules**, each designed for different types of content.

#### 1. **Native Preview**
- Uses Windows’ built-in preview handler (similar to File Explorer).
- Best for previewing Office documents (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, PDFs).

#### 2. **Web Preview**
- Loads websites in a Microsoft Edge WebView.
- Fully interactive—scroll, click links, and interact with the page like a normal browser.

#### 3. **Images**
- Displays images with zoom and basic interaction support.

#### 4. **Audio**
- Allows playback of audio files within Fluent Search.
- Includes controls for play, pause, and seek.

#### 5. **Text Files**

- May include syntax highlighting depending on your configuration.

#### 6. **File Manager**
- Previews folders in an **explorer-like interface**.
- Allows interaction with folder contents.

#### 7. **Folders**

Each module can be **enabled or disabled** based on your needs:
1. **Go to `Settings > Preview > Modules`**.
2. Enable or disable individual preview modules.
3. Configure **auto-preview** for specific result types.

#### Advanced Configurations
Some preview modules have additional settings:
- **Files Preview**: Adjust themes, text styles, and enable/disable editable mode.
- **Web Preview**: Customize the browser behavior and rendering settings.

By using Preview effectively, you can streamline your workflow, reduce unnecessary app switching, and verify results before opening them.
