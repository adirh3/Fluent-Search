## Fluent Search Privacy Policy

This page explains how Fluent Search handles your data, what stays on your device, and which features may communicate externally.

### 1\. Data Collection and User Activity Logging

By default, Fluent Search is designed to run locally. Your searches and most interactions are processed on your device.

Depending on your configuration, Fluent Search may send limited diagnostic information:

- **Crash diagnostics** (if enabled) to help improve stability.
- **Update checks** to determine whether a newer version is available.

Fluent Search does not attempt to upload your local files or the contents of what you search.

### 2\. Data Storage

Most Fluent Search data is stored **locally on your machine** (settings, caches, and indexes).

Optional features may store data outside your device only when you explicitly enable them. For example, settings sync (if enabled) may sync your Fluent Search settings via OneDrive.

To give you a clear picture of where Fluent Search stores its data, here's how it works:

#### Settings Storage:

*   **Installer Version:** Settings are saved in the App Data folder called **Blast**.
*   **Appx/Microsoft Store Version:** Settings are stored in a containerized App Data folder named **Blast**.
*   **Portable Version:** Settings are kept in a folder next to the executable, also called **Blast**.

#### Indexer Storage:

*   **Installer Version:** Indexed data is stored in the Program Data folder named **Fluent Search**. This folder can be accessed only by an administrator, adding an extra layer of security.
*   **Appx/Microsoft Store Version:** Indexed data is stored in the Program Data folder named **Fluent Search**, also accessible only by an administrator.
*   **Portable Version:** Indexed data is stored in a folder next to the executable called **Cache**.

### 3\. Access to Data

Fluent Search runs on your device. Some features can interact with external services when enabled:

- **Web search** opens searches in your browser and may use web suggestion providers depending on your configuration.
- **Optional plugins** can integrate with third-party services (for example: translation services or task providers). Only enable plugins you trust.

### 4\. Data Retention

Because Fluent Search doesn't collect or store personal data beyond what's necessary for it to function on your device, there's no data retention policy needed. Any temporary data the app uses is handled by your system and is kept only as long as needed for the app to run smoothly.

### 5\. User Control Over Data Collection

You have **full control** over how Fluent Search operates. While the app doesn't collect data, you can adjust settings within the app to disable any features you're not comfortable with, including crash diagnostics. To stop sending crash reports, simply disable the **"Send crash diagnostics"** option in Settings.
