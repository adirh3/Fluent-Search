## When to use

- **Before switching to other apps/windows** — prevents the search window from staying on top
- **Before sending keystrokes or typing text** — ensures input goes to the target application, not Fluent Search
- **After launching a program** — cleans up the UI

This is one of the most commonly used operations in Task projects.
