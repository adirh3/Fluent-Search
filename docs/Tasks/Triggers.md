# Triggers

A **trigger** is what starts an operations chain.

This page is an index. Each trigger type has its own page:

- [Search](Triggers/Search.md)
- [Result selector](Triggers/Result%20selector.md)
- [Hotkey](Triggers/Hotkey.md)

Tip: Community Task projects are a great place to see real trigger setups:
