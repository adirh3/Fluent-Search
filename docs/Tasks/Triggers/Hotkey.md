# Hotkey trigger

Hotkey triggers start a Task chain when a configured hotkey is pressed.

Hotkey triggers are configured in the Task editor UI (and may not be present as explicit `type:` nodes in shared `.yaml` examples).

## Practical tips

- Avoid conflicts with OS shortcuts and Fluent Search global hotkeys.
- If a hotkey doesn’t fire, test a simpler combination and verify Fluent Search has the required permissions for global hotkeys.
