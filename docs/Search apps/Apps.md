## Apps Search App in Fluent Search

The **Apps** Search App helps you find and launch applications installed on your computer.

This is the “launcher” side of Fluent Search: if you know the name of what you want to open, you can get there in a few keystrokes.

### Common use cases

- Launch installed apps (including many “legacy” apps that appear in Control Panel)
- Open app shortcuts
- Launch apps with common operations (for example: run normally vs run as administrator) when available

### Useful Search Tags

You’ll typically see tags such as:

- `Apps` to focus on installed applications
- `Run` to run a command or open a path (Run-dialog style)

To use a tag:

1. Type the tag name
2. Press `Tab`
3. Type what you want to open

Examples:

- `Apps` + `Tab` → then type `visual studio`
- `Run` + `Tab` → then type `cmd` or `C:\Windows\System32`

### Tips

- If you mostly use Fluent Search as an app launcher, keep **Apps** enabled and consider setting other Search Apps to **Search Tag Only**.
- If you frequently launch a specific app, consider pinning it (if available in your version) or creating a dedicated hotkey in the Hotkeys settings.
