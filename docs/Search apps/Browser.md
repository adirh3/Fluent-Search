## Browser Search App in Fluent Search

<img alt="Fluent Search Window" src="/docs/images/BrowserHistoryLight.webp" width="600" height="auto">

The **Browser** Search App in Fluent Search helps you search browser bookmarks and history directly from the Fluent Search window.

It’s designed to be fast and “flow friendly”: you can locate a page you visited earlier today, open a bookmarked internal tool, or jump to a frequently used site without opening your browser first.

### Automatic Detection and Indexing

Fluent Search scans your system for supported web browsers and their profiles. Once detected, it reads bookmarks and browsing history so you can search them quickly.

#### Supported Browsers

- **Chromium-based browsers** such as Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Brave, Vivaldi, and Opera.

### Searching Bookmarks and History

To search through your bookmarks and browsing history:

1. **Activate Fluent Search**:
    - Press `Ctrl + Alt` to open the Fluent Search interface.

2. **Enter Your Query**:
    - Type keywords related to the desired bookmark or previously visited page.

3. **View Results**:
    - Matching bookmarks and history entries will appear in the search results.
    - Select the desired result to open it in your default browser.

If you’re looking for open tabs (not history/bookmarks), enable **Search in app content** in the Windows Search App settings.

### Useful Search Tags

The Browser Search App commonly exposes Search Tags such as:

- `Browser` (general browser searching)
- `History` (history-only)
- `Bookmark` (bookmarks-only)

To use a tag:

1. Type the tag name
2. Press `Tab`
3. Type your query

### Profile Management

Fluent Search allows you to manage which browser profiles are included in the search index.

#### Enabling or Disabling Profiles

1. **Open Settings**:
    - Activate Fluent Search (`Ctrl + Alt`).
    - Type `settings` and select the **Settings** option.

2. **Navigate to Browser Settings**:
    - In the Settings window, go to `Apps` > `Browser` > `Profiles`.

3. **Manage Profiles**:
    - A list of detected browser profiles will be displayed.
    - Use the toggle switch next to each profile to enable or disable it.

#### Adding Profiles Manually

If a profile isn't detected automatically, you can add it manually:

1. **In the Profiles Section**:
    - Click the `Add Profile` button.

2. **Enter Profile Details**:
    - **Browser Type**: Select the browser type (for example: Chrome/Edge/Brave).
    - **Profile Name**: Assign a name to the profile.
    - **Profile Path**: Specify the path to the profile directory.

3. **Save the Profile**:
    - Click `Save` to include the new profile in the search index.

### Privacy notes

Browser searching is intended to happen locally on your machine. If you enable other features (for example, web suggestions or third-party plugins), review their settings to understand what they use.

By leveraging the Browser Search App, you can quickly access bookmarks and history from Fluent Search and reduce time spent hunting through browser tabs.
