## Windows Search App in Fluent Search

The **Windows** Search App helps you find open windows and running processes so you can switch context quickly.

This is most useful when you have many apps open and want to jump to the right one without Alt-Tabbing through everything.

---

### Common use cases

- Switch to an already-open window
- Find a running process by name
- Use available actions on a running app/window (depending on your configuration)

---

### Search Tag

The Windows Search App typically exposes a `Windows` tag.

To use it:

1. Type `Windows`
2. Press `Tab`
3. Type what you’re looking for

### Search inside open apps (tabs/UI)

Many users want to search **in-window content**, like open browser tabs.

The Windows Search App can do this when **Search in app content** is enabled.

To enable it:

1. Open Fluent Search settings
2. Go to `Settings` > `Apps` > `Windows`
3. Enable **Search in app content**

Notes:

- This can be slower than normal window/process searching because Fluent Search needs to inspect window content.
- If you enable Fluent Search’s speech features, in-window content search may be disabled automatically.

### Tips

- If you don’t want window/process results in “search anything”, set Windows to **Search Tag Only** and use it only when you explicitly need it.
- If you mainly use Fluent Search to switch between apps, keep Windows enabled and consider setting less-used Search Apps to tag-only.
