## Settings Search App

The **Settings** Search App helps you quickly open Windows system settings and Fluent Search configuration pages. Instead of navigating through menus, just type what you're looking for and jump directly to the right settings page.

### What it searches

- **Fluent Search settings** — Jump to any Fluent Search configuration page
- **System tray items** — Search and access items in your system tray (notification area)

### Search sources

The Settings Search App can search different sources based on your preference:

| Mode | Description |

### Multi-language support

The Settings Search App can index Windows settings in multiple languages simultaneously. This is useful if you use Windows in one language but sometimes think of settings in another.

- **Display language** — Choose which language to show results in

To configure: **Settings → Apps → Settings**.

### Tips

- If you rarely search for settings, set this Search App to **Search Tag Only** so it doesn't add noise to everyday searches
- Use it as your primary way to navigate Windows settings — it's faster than clicking through the Settings app manually
- The Fluent Search settings search mode is handy when you can't remember where a specific option lives
