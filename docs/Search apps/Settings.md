## Settings Search App in Fluent Search

The **Settings** Search App helps you quickly open system settings and configuration pages.

Instead of remembering where a setting lives in Windows, you can search for it and open it directly.

### Common use cases

### Tips

- If you use Fluent Search as your primary way to navigate system settings, keep this enabled.
- If you rarely use it, set it to **Search Tag Only** to keep “search anything” results focused.
