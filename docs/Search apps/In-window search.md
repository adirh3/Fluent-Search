## In-window Search in Fluent Search

In-window search helps you search inside the currently focused application/window (when supported).

This is useful when you want to stay on the keyboard and avoid context switching: instead of opening a browser and hunting for the right tab, or scanning a complex UI, you can search for what you want and act on it.

### How to use it

- Use the **In-window search hotkey** (default: `Ctrl + Alt + Shift`).
- Start typing the thing you want to find.

Depending on the app and what’s currently focused, results may represent UI elements, in-app content, or other context-aware items.

If you’re specifically trying to search things like open browser tabs, enable **Search in app content** in the Windows Search App settings (see [Windows.md](Windows.md)).

### Tips

- If in-window results feel incomplete for a specific app, try switching to normal search (`Ctrl + Alt`) and use Search Tags instead.
- Use `Alt + T` to focus Search Tags and narrow results further when available.
