<img alt="Fluent Search Window" src="/docs/images/SearchAppsSettingsLight.webp" width="700" height="auto">

Fluent Search offers a variety of **Search Apps** that allow you to locate and access different resources on your computer efficiently. Each Search App focuses on a specific type of content, such as files, applications, browser data, or system settings. Understanding and managing these Search Apps can enhance your productivity and streamline your workflow.

### Default Search Apps

Upon installation, Fluent Search includes several Search Apps. The exact set can vary by version and your enabled features, but commonly includes:

- **Apps**: Search apps installed on your computer and launch them.
- **Files**: Search for files and folders using your configured file indexer.
- **Browser**: Search browser history and bookmarks from supported Chromium-based browsers.
- **Commands**: Run commands and reuse command history.
- **Web**: Search the web using your configured search engines.
- **Windows**: Find open windows and running processes.
- **Settings**: Jump to system/app settings.
- **Calculator**: Do quick calculations.

Tip: The Windows Search App can optionally search inside open apps (for example, browser tabs) when **Search in app content** is enabled.

The fastest workflow is usually to keep only the Search Apps you actively use enabled.

### Managing Search Apps

Fluent Search allows you to customize which Search Apps are active, tailoring the search experience to your needs.

#### Enabling or Disabling Search Apps

1. **Open Fluent Search Settings**:
    - Activate Fluent Search by pressing `Ctrl + Alt`.
    - Type `settings` and select the **Settings** option.

2. **Navigate to Apps**:
    - In the Settings window, go to **Apps**.

3. **Toggle Search Apps**:
    - You'll see a list of available Search Apps.
    - To enable or disable a Search App, toggle the **Search with App** switch next to its name.
        - **Enabled**: Fluent Search will include this app in search results.
        - **Disabled**: The app will be excluded from search operations and suggestions.

#### Configuring Search Apps

Each Search App offers customization options:

- **Search Tag Only**: Enable this to make Fluent Search use the app only when a specific search tag is provided.

- **Search Hotkey**: Assign a hotkey to open Fluent Search and search exclusively within that app.

- **Operation Hotkeys**: Set hotkeys to perform specific actions when a result from the app is focused.

### Recommended setup patterns

#### Keep results focused

- Enable only what you use daily (for example: Apps, Files, Commands, Browser).
- Set less common apps to **Search Tag Only** so they don’t add noise.

#### Create “jump in” hotkeys

If you often do one specific thing (like file search), assign a dedicated hotkey to open Fluent Search already scoped to that Search App.

To configure these settings:

1. **Access the App's Settings**:
    - In the **Apps** section, click on the desired app to open its settings page.

2. **Adjust Settings**:
    - Modify the available options as needed to suit your workflow.

By effectively managing your Search Apps, you can optimize Fluent Search to provide relevant results tailored to your preferences.

For app-specific setup guides, see the pages in this section (Files, Browser, Commands, Web).

Note: Fluent Search also supports **search shortcuts** (input → mapped query). Those are configured under `Settings` > `Search` > `Experience`, not as a Search App.
