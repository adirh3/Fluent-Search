2. Navigate to **Screen → Customization**

### Customization options

#### Label characters

Choose which characters appear in the hint labels that identify clickable areas on screen.

- **Default:** `ASDWJKLIFHQERNOUMCXVZGBTYP`
- Characters are assigned in order — the labels use combinations of these characters
- Use characters that are easy to type quickly on your keyboard layout
- Avoid characters that conflict with Screen Search action keys (like `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`)

#### Label size

Adjust the size of the hint labels. Larger labels are easier to see but may overlap more elements.

- **Range:** 1 to 40
- **Default:** 14
- Find the right balance between visibility and screen coverage for your display resolution

#### Label borders

Toggle thin borders around each label. Borders improve visibility against varied backgrounds, especially on busy screens.

- **Default:** On (borders shown)
- Try both options to see which provides better contrast on your typical workspace

#### Label positioning

Choose where labels appear relative to the interactive elements they represent:

| Position | Description |
|---|---|
| **Center** | Places the label directly over the element |
| **Center Below** (default) | Positions the label just below the element — prevents the label from obscuring the element |
| **Left Center** | Aligns the label to the left side of the element |
| **Left Below** | Places the label to the left and below the element |

Adjusting position can prevent labels from overlapping important on-screen content.

#### Background color

Set a custom background color for labels to ensure they stand out against your applications and desktop wallpaper.

- Use the color picker to select a color, or enter a specific hex color code
- **Tip:** Choose a contrasting color that differs from your most-used applications' color schemes
- When disabled, labels use the default accent-based coloring

#### Keep mouse position

By default, Screen Search may return the mouse cursor to its original position after performing a click. Enable **Keep mouse position after click** to leave the mouse at the clicked element's location.

### Tips

- **High-DPI displays:** Consider increasing the label size for better readability on high-resolution screens
- **Busy screens:** Use "Center Below" positioning to keep labels from covering the elements they represent
- **Dark themes:** A lighter label background color improves visibility
- **Presentations:** Increase label size and use bold background colors when demonstrating Screen Search to others
