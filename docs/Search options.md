## Customizing Search Options in Fluent Search

Fluent Search offers a **highly customizable search experience**, allowing users to fine-tune how results are displayed, grouped, and prioritized. By adjusting these settings, you can **speed up search, improve relevance, and control interactions**.

### Fuzzy Search

Fuzzy Search is typically enabled by default and helps find results even when there are minor typos or missing characters. If you prefer strict matching, disable it in **Settings > Search > Experience**.

### Search Shortcuts

Search shortcuts allow you to **map specific input to a predefined search query**. This reduces typing effort for frequently used searches.

Example:
- Typing **`mcd`** can be mapped to **`my cool document`**, instantly searching long terms.

To configure shortcuts:
1. **Go to `Settings > Search > Experience > Search mappings`**.
2. **Create a new shortcut** by assigning an input phrase and the corresponding search command.

### Results Grouping

Grouping results makes it easier to navigate search results. Fluent Search provides **three grouping modes**:

- **By Type**: Groups results based on file type (e.g., applications, files, web pages).
- **By Related App**: Groups results based on the application that generated them.
- **Smart Grouping**: Uses an intelligent algorithm to automatically organize results in the most relevant way.

To enable or change grouping:
1. **Open `Settings > Search > Results > Group search results`**.
2. **Select the preferred grouping method**.

### Disabling Delete Features

By default, Fluent Search **allows deleting files and other items** directly from search results. If you prefer a safer search experience, you can **disable deletion features**.

To do this:
1. **Go to `Settings > Search > Results`**.
2. **Toggle off the delete options**.

This ensures no accidental deletions occur while using Fluent Search.

### Searching inside open apps (tabs/UI)

If you want to search inside open windows (for example, browser tabs), enable **Search in app content** in the Windows Search App.

See [Search apps/Windows.md](Search%20apps/Windows.md) for details.

### Prioritizing Search Results

Fluent Search allows users to **set rules for prioritizing certain results**. This helps control **which results appear first**, making searches faster and more relevant.

#### How Prioritization Works:
- You can set rules to **prioritize results** based on:
    - **Name** (e.g., results starting with “Project” appear first).
    - **Context** (e.g., prefer files from a specific folder).
    - **Tags** (e.g., prioritize “documents” over “images”).
    - **Search App** (e.g., prioritize results from Files over Web).

#### Configuring Prioritization:
1. **Go to `Settings > Search > Prioritization`**.
2. **Add new rules** to define how results should be ranked.
3. **Use wildcards, “starts with,” or exact matches** for more control.

Additionally, many result lists can be sorted or filtered depending on the Search App and the current result type.

By customizing these search options, you can optimize Fluent Search to match your workflow and keep results focused on what you actually use.
