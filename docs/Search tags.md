Fluent Search offers **Search Tags** as a powerful way to refine search results and retrieve more relevant information. Whether you’re looking for specific files, browser history, web results, or filtering search results by file type, **Search Tags** provide a quick and efficient way to focus your search.

### What Are Search Tags?

Search tags act as filters that help narrow down search results within Fluent Search. Instead of searching broadly, adding a search tag ensures that only relevant results are displayed.

For example:
- Searching `report` might show apps, files, and web suggestions.
- Searching **`.pdf`** as a tag focuses results on PDF files.

### How to Use Search Tags

Using search tags is simple:
1. **Type the tag name**, such as `files` or `history`.
2. **Press `Tab`** to insert the tag into the search bar.
3. **Enter your search term**, and Fluent Search will apply the tag filter.

You can combine multiple tags to refine results further.

Tip: You can also focus the Search Tags area using **`Alt + T`** (default) and pick tags from there.

### Viewing Available Tags

Fluent Search provides multiple ways to see available and supported tags:
- Each **Search App** settings page lists the relevant tags it supports.
- The **Search Tags** page (`Settings > Search tags`) shows all available search tags.
- Clicking on a tag in the settings takes you to the respective configuration page, where you can modify or disable it.

### Custom and Ignored Search Tags

Fluent Search allows full customization of search tags:
- **Create Custom Tags**: You can define your own search tags, such as shortcuts to specific folders.
- **Ignore Search Tags**: If certain tags are unnecessary, you can disable them in settings to prevent accidental activation.

### Common Search Tag Scenarios

Here are some real-world scenarios where search tags can enhance your experience:

#### Searching for Specific Content
- **`Files`** → Search files and folders.
- **`History`** → Search through browser history.
- **`Web`** (or a specific web engine tag) → Perform a web search.

#### Searching Inside Specific Folders

- Type an **exact folder path**, press `TAB`, and Fluent Search will insert it as a tag, allowing searches inside that folder.
- Combine a **folder path** with **file type tags** to refine searches, e.g., searching `C:\Projects\ reports .docx` will find Word documents inside the Projects folder.

#### Filtering by File Type
- **Use file extensions as tags**: Typing `.png` will show only PNG files, and the same applies for `.pdf`, `.mp4`, etc.
- **Pre-configured file type tags** exist for filtering by content type:
    - `images:` → Filters only image files (PNG, JPG, GIF, etc.).
    - `documents:` → Filters only document files (PDF, DOCX, TXT, etc.).
    - `audio:` → Filters only audio files (MP3, WAV, etc.).
    - `videos:` → Filters only video files (MP4, AVI, etc.).

#### Searching Browsing History for Specific Sites
- Type a website URL (e.g., `https://learn.microsoft.com`), press `TAB`, and Fluent Search can use it as a focused search value depending on which Search App handles the tag.

### Customizing Search Tags

Many search tags are configurable in Fluent Search settings:
- Adjust the behavior of file-related tags in **Files Settings**.
- Modify or create web search tags in **Web Settings**.
- Click on any tag in the **Search Tags settings page** to jump to its customization page.

By mastering search tags, you can significantly improve search accuracy and efficiency, making Fluent Search a highly effective tool tailored to your needs.
