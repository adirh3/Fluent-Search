## Hotkeys in Fluent Search

Fluent Search offers a robust hotkey system to enhance productivity and streamline your workflow. Setting up a few “muscle memory” shortcuts is often the biggest speed-up you can get.

### Types of Hotkeys

Fluent Search provides two primary types of hotkeys:

1. **Hotkeys**: These can be activated from anywhere, regardless of which application is in focus.
2. **Keyboard Gestures**: These are specific to Fluent Search and function only when the Fluent Search window is active.

Most people only need a handful:

- **Search (search anything)**: `Ctrl + Alt` (default)
- **In-window search**: `Ctrl + Alt + Shift` (default)
- **Focus Search Tags**: `Alt + T` (default)
- **Toggle Preview**: `Alt + P` (default)

### Accessing and Configuring Hotkeys

To view and modify hotkeys:

1. Open Fluent Search.
2. Navigate to `Settings` > `Hotkeys`.

Here, you can assign or change hotkeys for various functions, including launching Fluent Search modes, opening Search Apps directly, and triggering operations on results.

### Assigning Global Hotkeys to Search Apps and Tags

You can set up global hotkeys to quickly access specific Search Apps or apply tags:

1. In the `Hotkeys` settings, select the desired Search App or tag.
2. Assign a unique key combination.

This setup allows you to, for example, press a specific key combination to jump straight into Files search or open Fluent Search already filtered to Browser history.

### Managing Hotkeys in Specific Scenarios

Fluent Search offers flexibility to prevent hotkeys from interfering with other activities:

- **Ignoring Hotkeys in Full-Screen Applications**: Enable this setting to disable hotkeys when running full-screen applications, such as games or video players.
- **Ignoring Hotkeys for Specific Processes**: Specify process names for which hotkeys should be disabled.

These options effectively act as **Gaming mode**. See [Gaming mode](Gaming%20mode.md) for practical recommendations and troubleshooting.

### Tips

- Prefer combinations you don’t use elsewhere (for example: `Ctrl + Alt + Space`).
- Avoid common app shortcuts (for example: `Ctrl + Shift + P`).
- After changing a hotkey, try it in a few contexts (desktop, browser, IDE, full-screen) to confirm it behaves the way you want.

Activating these settings puts Fluent Search into a more “hands off” mode, preventing accidental popups during full-screen apps (games, presentations, remote sessions).

### Important Considerations

When configuring hotkeys, keep these rules of thumb in mind:

- Prefer combinations you don’t use elsewhere (for example: `Ctrl + Alt + Space`).
- Avoid common app shortcuts (for example: `Ctrl + Shift + P`).
- If a hotkey is already taken by another tool, Fluent Search may not receive it.

After changing a hotkey, try it in a few contexts (desktop, browser, IDE, full-screen) to confirm it behaves the way you want.

By customizing hotkeys to fit your workflow, Fluent Search becomes a more powerful and efficient tool, tailored to your specific needs.
