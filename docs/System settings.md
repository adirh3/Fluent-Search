### Performance Settings

Optimize Fluent Search's performance based on your system's capabilities:

- **Performance Mode**: Allocates more system resources to Fluent Search for faster search results.
- **Reduce Memory Usage**: Minimizes RAM consumption, which may slightly impact search speed.
- **Use GPU**: Leverages your graphics processor to enhance performance, especially beneficial for graphic-intensive tasks.

### Sync Options

Keep your Fluent Search settings consistent across devices:

- **Import/Export Settings**: Manually back up or transfer your settings by exporting them to a file, which can then be imported on another device or after a system reset.

### Update Preferences

Manage how Fluent Search updates on your system:

- **Release Feed**: Choose between:
    - **Stable**: Receives thoroughly tested updates, ensuring reliability.
    - **Nightly (Beta)**: Accesses the latest features and improvements, though they may be less stable. Note that this option is not available if Fluent Search is installed via the Microsoft Store.
    - **Important**: Downgrading from Nightly back to Stable isn’t currently supported via the release feed. To return to Stable, reinstall a Stable build.
- **Auto Update**: When enabled, Fluent Search will silently install updates in the background, keeping the application up-to-date without manual intervention.

By configuring these system settings, you can tailor Fluent Search to align with your workflow and system requirements, ensuring an efficient and personalized user experience.
